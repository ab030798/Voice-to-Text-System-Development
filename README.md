Task 2:
Title: Voice-to-Text System Development
Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a robust voice-to-text (speech recognition)
system capable of accurately transcribing spoken language into textual form. The system should be able
to process audio input from various sources and environments, converting it into written text with high
accuracy and efficiency. 
Scope:
1. Develop a speech recognition system capable of processing audio input in real-time or near realtime.
2. Select and implement appropriate speech recognition algorithms and techniques, considering
factors such as noise robustness, language support, and latency.
3. Integrate pre-trained speech recognition models or develop custom models using machine
learning approaches, such as deep learning-based architectures (e.g., convolutional neural
networks, recurrent neural networks, transformer models).
4. Optimize the system for performance across different accents, and speaking styles.
5.  Implement features for handling audio pre-processing, including noise reduction, voice activity
detection, and audio normalization.
6. Support for streaming audio input for continuous transcription in real-time applications.
Deliverable:
1. Functional speech recognition system capable of converting audio input into text with specified
accuracy and performance metrics.
2. Deploy the model on Git
3. Integration with audio input sources and interfaces for real-time transcription. 4. Documentation summarizing system architecture, algorithms, implementation details, . 5. Evaluation results demonstrating the performance of the speech recognition system across
different test scenarios and data sets.
